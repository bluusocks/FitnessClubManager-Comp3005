Design and implement an application for a ”Health and Fitness Club Management System”. This system will
serve as a comprehensive platform catering to the diverse needs of club members, trainers, and administrative
staff.
Members should be able to register and manage their profiles, setting personal fitness goals and inputting health
metrics. Once registered, they will gain access to a personalized dashboard that tracks their exercise routines,
fitness achievements, and health statistics. The platform will also enable members to schedule, reschedule, or
cancel personal training sessions with certified trainers. Furthermore, members can register for group fitness
classes, workshops, and other events, ensuring they always stay updated with their schedules and receive timely
reminders for their sessions.
On the other side, the system should empower trainers with tools to manage their schedules, view member
profiles, and input progress notes after each training session. Administrative staff, the backbone of the club’s
operations, should have features that allow them to oversee club resources effectively. This includes managing
room bookings, monitoring fitness equipment maintenance, and updating class schedules. Additionally, they
should have a robust system to oversee billing, process payments for membership fees, personal training sessions,
and other services, and monitor club activities for quality assurance. The club’s unique selling point is its loyalty program; every transaction earns members loyalty points, which can be redeemed for future services.

STEP 1.
FIGURE OUT THE DATABASE.

1a. ER --> Schema --> Write out dependencies --> normalize --> final schema

1b. Write SQL to create tables --> SQL to populate with dummy values

STEP 2.
Front end (agony)

I literally don't want to do this
